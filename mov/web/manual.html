<h2>Merchant of Venice Manual</h2>





<h2>
<a name="Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Thank you for trying Merchant of Venice (Venice).</p>


<p>Project Venice was started with the question of how well could
Genetic Programming be applied to generating successful buy/sell rules on the 
stock market? With some promising preliminary results, the project scope 
expanded and Venice was re-written.</p>


<p>Venice now supports portfolio management, charting, technical analysis all
within a graphical user interface with on-line help. The current direction
of the project is to re-implement Genetic Programming.</p>




<h2>
<a name="Preferences"></a>2 Preferences</h2>



<h2>
<a name="Functions"></a>2.1 Functions</h2>

<p>This section hasn't been written yet.</p>



<h2>
<a name="Quote%20Source"></a>2.2 Quote Source</h2>

<p>Venice currently supports two methods for reading in quotes. It can either
read in the quotes directly from files containing quotes in MetaStock, 
EzyChart or Insight Trader. Or it can read in quotes stored in a MySQL
database. Reading from files is quick and easy to set up - but access is much
slower than from database. It is recommended that you set up access for files 
to start with and if you plan to use Venice to switch to the database.</p>

<p>You can reach quote source configuration by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on the <i>File</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on the <i>Preferences</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then selecting the <i>Quote Source</i> page.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>2.2.1 File Quote Source</h3>

<p>Once you have reached the quote source page, to tell Venice to read quotes
directly from files click on the <i>Files</i> tab and select the <i>Use Files</i> 
radio button. You'll need to know the format of your quote files. 
Venice supports the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>MetaStock</i>
</p>

<p>      This format has 4 digit years and the quotes are in dollars. The first
      column is the symbol, then the date, open, high, low, close and volume.</p>

<p>      Example:</p>

<p>
<code>      XXX,19990715,1.73,1.82,1.71,1.81,3648921</code>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<i>MetaStock (volume/100)</i>
</p>

<p>      This format is the same as <i>MetaStock</i> above but the volume is divided 
      by 100.</p>

<p>      Example:</p>

<p>
<code>      XXX,19990715,1.73,1.82,1.71,1.81,36489</code>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<i>Insight Trader</i>
</p>

<p>      This format has 2 digit years and quotes are in cents and volume is
      divided by 100. The first column is the symbol, then the date, open, 
      high, low, close and volume.</p>

<p>      Example:</p>

<p>
<code>      XXX 07/15/99 173 182 171 181 36489</code>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<i>EzyChart</i>
</p>

<p>      This format has 2 digit years and quotes are in cents. The first column 
      is the symbol, then the date, open, high, low, close and volume.</p>

<p>
<code>      XXX,990715,173,182,171,181,3648921</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can then tell Venice where the quotes files are by either adding them
here with the <i>Add</i> button or by using the <a href="#Importing%20Quotes">Import Quotes</a> dialog.</p>


<h3>2.2.2 Database Quote Source</h3>

<p>Once you have played with Venice for a while you might get annoyed at the time
it takes Venice to load quotes from files. You can fix this by reading quotes
from a database. Currently Venice only supports reading quotes from a
MySQL database. To read quotes from a database, you'll need to download
a copy of MySQL and a software driver that lets Venice talk to MySQL.</p>


<p>You can download MySQL from http://www.mysql.com and you can also download
a software driver from them too. Their software driver is available at
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html. Venice also supports
a software driver called <i>mm.mysql</i> which is available
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmmysql. Both are good, get either,
although I use the later. See documentation in MySQL and the driver for how to
set all this up.</p>


<p>Once all that is done, you'll need to configure Venice to use the database.
From the quote source page, to tell Venice to read quotes from the database 
click on the <i>Database</i> tab and select the <i>Use Database</i>
radio button. You'll be confronted with several fields you need to fill in:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Database</i> - The only database supported is MySQL, so you can leave 
      this alone.
</li>

<li>
<i>Host</i> - This is the IP address of the computer that the database is 
      running on. If it is running on the same machine as Venice, you can just
      put <i>localhost</i> here if you want.
</li>

<li>
<i>Port</i> - This is the port that the database is listening on.
      You shouldn't need to touch this.
</li>

<li>
<i>Username</i> - This is the user name that Venice will connect with in
      the database. You should have created a user/password pair when setting
      up the database.
</li>

<li>
<i>Password</i> - This is the password that Venice will connect with in
      the database. You should have created a user/password pair when setting 
      up the database.
</li>

<li>
<i>Database Name</i> - This is the name of the database Venice will create. 
      You shouldn't need to touch this.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally you'll need to import the quotes into the database, you can do this by 
using the <a href="#Importing%20Quotes">Import Quotes</a> dialog.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>
<a name="Importing%20Quotes"></a>3 Importing Quotes</h2>

<p>Before you import quotes, you'll need to decide whether Venice will read the
quotes directly from files or from a MySQL database. See <a href="#Quote%20Source">Quote Source</a>
to set this all up.</p>

<p>You can reach the import quotes dialog by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on the <i>File</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on the <i>Import Quotes</i> menu item.
</li>

</ul>

<p>This dialog is very versatile and lets you perform several import/export
operations:</p>


<h3>3.1 Import quote files into the Database</h3>

<p>To perform this operation:</p>

<p>Click on <i>Files</i> in the <i>Import From</i> area and on <i>Database</i>
in the <i>Import To</i> area.</p>

<p>This allows you to import multiple quote files into the database in one 
operation. Importing quotes into the database can take a while, so please be 
patient. You need to select the quote type you are importing, see
<a href="#Quote%20Source">Quote Source</a> for an explanation of these types.
When you click <i>Import</i> a dialog will come up and you can select
multiple quote files.</p>



<h3>3.2 Import quote files into Venice</h3>

<p>To perform this operation:</p>

<p>Click on <i>Files</i> in the <i>Import From</i> area and on <i>Files</i>
in the <i>Import To</i> area.</p>

<p>This allows you to import multiple quote files into Venice in one
operation. This operation only tells Venice about the quote files, it doesn't
copy them in anyway - so if you delete the original quote files, Venice 
obviously won't be able to access them anymore.</p>



<h3>3.3 Import quote files into Venice and the Database</h3>

<p>To perform this operation:</p>

<p>Click on <i>Files</i> in the <i>Import From</i> area and on <i>Files</i>
and <i>Database</i> in the <i>Import To</i> area.</p>

<p>This operation performs the combination of the above two operations it will
import the files into the database and also into Venice. This is useful if
you access the files via the database, but would like Venice to be able to
cope if the database goes down.</p>



<h3>3.4 Export quote files from the Database</h3>

<p>To perform this operation:</p>

<p>Click on <i>Database</i> in the <i>Import From</i> area and on <i>Files</i>
in the <i>Import To</i> area.</p>

<p>This allows you to export all the quote files from the database back into text 
files. Each file will contain quotes for a single day. You'll need to specify 
the format of the quotes in the file you want, see <a href="#Quote%20Source">Quote Source</a> 
for more details. You'll also need to specify the path and file name for the 
generated files in the text box showing. Each file is named with the date
as part of it's file name, you'll need to specify the format of the date.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>/home/aleppard/quotes-mm-dd-yyyy.txt
      -&gt; /home/aleppard/quotes-12-31-2002.txt
</li>

<li>/home/aleppard/market_ddMMMyy.txt 
      -&gt; /home/aleppard/market_31dec02.txt
</li>

<li>C:\Quotes\Quotes_d?_m?_yy.txt
      -&gt; C:\Quotes\Quotes_1_5_02.txt
</li>
</ul>

<p>What if the string <i>mm</i>, <i>dd</i>, <i>MMM</i> or <i>yy</i> appears in my
destination file but isn't meant to be part of the date string? Well it won't
work.</p>




<h2>
<a name="Tables"></a>4 Tables</h2>

<p>Venice has the ability to list quote prices for a single day's trading into a
table. When listing the day's trading you need to decide which stocks you
are interested in. Currently you can select from <i>All Ordinaries</i>, 
<i>Market Indices</i> and <i>All Symbols</i>. These categories
are based on the ASX (Australian Stock Exchange) so might not be very relevant
for other exchanges. Currently Venice is very ASX-centric. At the moment 
Venice does not have access to any data relating to the symbols it is given, so
it has to guess which category the symbol falls in. All Ordinaries lists all 
3 letter symbols except those starting with an <b>X</b>. 
Market Indices lists all symbols starting with an <b>X</b>, on 
the ASX almost all of these are market indices. All Symbols lists all the
symbols.</p>


<p>You can display a table by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on the <i>Table</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on either <i>All Ordinaries</i>, <i>Market Indices</i> or
      <i>All Symbols</i>.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on either <i>List All</i> or <i>List By Rule</i>.
</li>

</ul>


<p>The <i>List By Rule</i> option allows you to specify the initial
filter. The filter is an equation which specifies which stocks should be
listed and which hidden, see below for more details about this, also see the
<a href="#Gondola%20Language">Gondola Language</a> for details about the format of 
the equations.</p>


<h3>4.1 Apply Equations</h3>

<p>You can run multiple equations against every stock listed in the table and
list the result of the equation. Click on the <i>Quote</i> menu item, then 
click on the <i>Apply Equations</i> menu item. This will bring up a dialog 
where you can enter up to 5 equations that can be run against each stock. For 
each you can enter the name of the column and the equation to be run. See 
<a href="#Gondola%20Language">Gondola Language</a> for details about the format of these equations. 
Also see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a> for how to get Venice to remember equations 
so you don't have to keep typing them in all the time. To get you started, an 
example equation is <code>avg(day_close, 30, 0)</code> which will calculate the average 
day close value over the last 30 days, including today.</p>



<h3>4.2 Apply Filter</h3>

<p>You can restrict which stocks are listed in the table by setting up an equation
filter. This equation is run against each stock listed in the table, if the
equation equates to true for a stock, then that stock is listed. Otherwise it
is hidden. You can reach this by clicking on the <i>Apply Filter</i> menu item.
Again, see <a href="#Gondola%20Language">Gondola Language</a> for details about the format of these equations. 
Also see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a> for how to get Venice to remember equations so 
you don't have to keep typing them in all the time. To get you started, an 
example equation filter is <code>lag(day_close, 0) &gt; lag(day_close, -1)</code> which will 
list all quotes where the day close of today is higher than the day close of 
the last trading day.</p>



<h3>4.3 General Table Features</h3>

<p>Every table in Venice supports the following:</p>


<p>By clicking on a column header you can sort by that column, click again and 
you reverse the sort. You can change the order of the columns by dragging a 
column and dropping it into a new position.</p>


<p>Some tables in Venice support the following:</p>

<p>By right clicking on a row you can raise a context sensitive menu. If you 
double click on a row the most common operation is invoked, typically 
Graphing. Some tables also have a menu item <i>Show Columns</i> which lets 
you specify which columns are shown.</p>




<h2>
<a name="Graphs"></a>5 Graphs</h2>

<h3>5.1 Portfolio Graphs</h3>

<p>You can graph the value of any portfolio over time by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on the <i>Graph</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on the <i>Portfolio</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on the name of the portfolio you wish to graph.
</li>

</ul>


<p>Depending on the size of your portfolio and the time it has existed, this
might take a while as Venice has to load in stock quotes for every stock
traded for every day of the portfolio.</p>


<p>Apart from graphing the value of the portfolio over time, you can also graph
the profit/loss of the portfolio. To do this, graph the portfolio as above,
then click on the menu item with the same name as your portfolio, then select 
the <i>Graph</i> menu item and then click on <i>Profit/Loss</i>. The profit and loss 
graph is calculated by ignoring any deposits and withdrawals made to the 
portfolio, the balance of that portfolio over time will reflect the profit and 
loss made.</p>



<h3>5.2 Market Indicator Charts</h3>

<p>A market indicator is an indicator that can be used to help determine the
state of the market. They are calculated using multiple stocks on the market,
for example <i>Advance/Decline</i> uses all ordinary stocks
in its calculations.</p>


<h3>5.2.1 Advance/Decline</h3>

<p>Currently the only market indicator that Venice can graph is the
advance/decline indicator. You can graph this indicator by:</p>


<ul>
<li>Clicking on <i>Graph</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on the <i>Market Indicator</i> menu item.
</li> 

<li>Then clicking on the <i>Advance/Decline</i> menu item.
</li>

</ul>

<p>This operation reads in almost all of the available stock quotes, so it might
be very slow.</p>

<p>The advance/decline indicator is calculated by taking an arbitrary start value 
(currently 0). Each day's value is calculated by taking the number of stocks 
that advanced (i.e. have a higher day close than day open) minus the number of
stocks that declined and adding that to the previous day's value. This creates
a cumulative graph whose trend may be used to give an indication of possible 
future direction of the market.</p>




<h3>5.3 Stock Charts</h3>


<p>This section hasn't been written yet.</p>





<h2>
<a name="Portfolios"></a>6 Portfolios</h2>

<p>Venice allows you to keep track of multiple portfolios. One portfolio
might be for your actual portfolio and others could be used for paper
trading. You can create a new portfolio by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on the <i>Files</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on the <i>Portfolio</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on the <i>New Portfolio</i> menu item.
</li>

</ul>

<p>A portfolio is made up of several <i>Cash Accounts</i> and several
<i>Share Accounts</i>. A <i>Cash Account</i> can be a bank account, a term deposit,
a Cash Management Account or any account which stores money. A <i>Share Account</i>
is any account where you can trade shares. To create a trading account you 
will need at least one of each.</p>

<p>A portfolio is made up of several accounts and also transactions. A 
transaction is any financial transaction that involves one or more of the
accounts. See transactions for more details.</p>

<h3>6.1 Import/Export</h3>

<p>You can import and export portfolios to CSV files (comma separated values)
these files can then be read by an Excel spreadsheet and other tools. This
can be useful for backup purposes. Venice is alpha after all! The format of
the output files is:</p>

<p>
<code>dd/mm/yyyy,transaction name,value,symbol,share number,trade cost,cash 
account1,cash account2,share account</code>
</p>

<p>Not all of these fields will be present, an example exported line is:</p>

<p>
<code>02/01/2003,Accumulate,4000.00,XYZ,100,20.50,Bank,,Broker</code>
</p>



<h3>6.2 Graph</h3>

<p>You can graph the value of a portfolio over time. See <a href="#Graphs">Graphs</a> 
for more details.</p>



<h3>6.3 Transaction History</h3>

<p>You can view a list of all the transactions that have occurred in the 
portfolio. You can reach this by clicking on the <i>Transaction</i> menu
item and then clicking on the <i>Show History</i> menu item.</p>



<h3>6.4 Transactions</h3>

<p>Venice currently supports several common transactions:
<i>Accumulate Transaction</i>, <i>Deposit Transaction</i>, <i>Dividend Transaction</i>, 
<i>Dividend DRP Transaction</i>, <i>Fee Transaction</i>, <i>Interest Transaction</i>, 
<i>Reduce Transaction</i>, <i>Transfer Transaction</i> and <i>Withdrawal Transaction</i>.</p>


<p>Once a portfolio is open, you can add a transaction by clicking on the 
<i>Transaction</i> menu item, then clicking on the <i>New</i> menu item. 
You will see in a drop down box a list of the transactions available. Some of 
these might not be available yet, e.g. you cannot enter a Reduce Transaction 
(sell shares) without having bought any.</p>


<h4>6.4.1 Accumulate Transaction</h4>

<p>The accumulate transaction is the "buy shares" transaction. To enter this
transaction you will need the date the transaction took place, the cash 
account where you withdrew the money from, the share account that accumulated 
the shares, the symbol of the stock you accumulated (e.g. CBA), the number of 
shares you accumulated, the total value of the shares at the time of purchase
and finally the cost of the trade. This information should all be available 
from your broker.</p>



<h4>6.4.2 Deposit Transaction</h4>

<p>The deposit transaction is the transaction where you
deposit money into a cash account such as a bank account. To enter this 
transaction you will need the date the transaction took place, the cash
account you deposited the money to and the amount you deposited.</p>



<h4>6.4.3 Dividend Transaction</h4>

<p>The dividend transaction is the transaction when you receive a share
dividend. To enter this transaction you will need the date the transaction
took place, the cash account that received the money, the share account
containing the stock, the symbol of the stock and the dividend amount paid to 
you.</p>



<h4>6.4.4 Dividend DRP Transaction</h4>

<p>The dividend DRP (dividend re-investment programme) transaction is the
transaction when you receive a share dividend that is automatically 
re-invested back into the company by buying more shares. To enter this
transaction you will need the date the transaction took place, the 
share account containing the stock, the symbol of the stock and the amount
of shares acquired.</p>



<h4>6.4.5 Fee Transaction</h4>

<p>The fee transaction is the transaction when you receive any kind of
fee such as account keeping fees, Tax etc. To enter this transaction you
will need the date the transaction took place, the cash account that
received the fee and the amount that you were charged.</p>



<h4>6.4.6 Interest Transaction</h4>

<p>The interest transaction is the transaction when you receive any
interest in one of your cash accounts. To enter this transaction you will
need the date the transaction took place, the cash account that received
the interest and the amount that you were credited. If your account is in
the negative and this was the interest that was debited from your account, 
then put a minus sign in front of the value.</p>



<h4>6.4.7 Reduce Transaction</h4>

<p>The reduce transaction is the "sell shares" transaction. To enter this
transaction you will need the date the transaction took place, the cash 
account where the money from the sale will go, the share account that
reduced the shares, the symbol of the stock you reduced (e.g. CBA), the
number of shares you reduced, the total value of the shares at the time of
sale and finally the cost of the trade. This information should all be 
available from your broker.</p>



<h4>6.4.8 Transfer Transaction</h4>

<p>The transfer transaction is the transaction where you transfer money from
one cash account to another. To enter this transaction you will need the
cash account where you withdrew the money, the destination cash account and
the amount you transferred. If there was a fee for the transfer, you need
to enter this as a separate transaction.</p>



<h4>6.4.9 Withdrawal Transaction</h4>

<p>The withdrawal transaction is the transaction where you
withdraw money from a cash account such as a bank account. To enter this 
transaction you will need the date the transaction took place, the cash
account you withdrew the money from and the amount you withdrew.</p>






<h2>
<a name="Gondola%20Language"></a>7 Gondola Language</h2>

<p>The <i>Gondola Language</i> is a language for analysing stock market data.
The language allows you to do a variety of tasks from listing stocks in tables
that only match your criteria to creating automated buy/sell paper trade rules.</p>


<p>Whenever you enter a Gondola expression there are two implicit variables that
are always set: the current date and the current stock. For example if
you are displaying a <a href="#Tables">Table</a> of stock quotes, you can execute an
equation for each stock. If you entered the current line:</p>


<p>
<code>avg(day_close, 30, 0)</code>
</p>


<p>It would display, for each stock, the average day close value over the last
30 days starting with today. Here the current date would be set to the most
recent day you have a quote for and the current stock would be set to the
current stock.</p>


<p>You can also enter equations when performing <a href="#Analysis">Paper Trading</a>. If you
entered the following as a buy rule:</p>


<p>
<code>avg(day_close, 15, 0) &gt; avg(day_close, 30, -1)</code>
</p>


<p>It would only buy the stock when the average day close over the last 15 days
was higher than the average day close of over the last 30 days, where the
30 day average would be calculated starting from the previous day and working
backwards. So here the current date would be set to whatever date the trade
was to be analysed for.</p>


<h3>7.1 Gondola Operators</h3>

<p>The gondola language supports the following boolean operators: <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>
and <i>not</i>. For example:</p>


<ul>
<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) &gt; 12 or lag(day_open, 0) &gt; 12
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) &gt; 12 and lag(day_open, 0) &gt; 12
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>not(avg(day_open, 15, 0) &gt; 12)
</code>
</li>

</ul>


<p>It also supports basic arithmetic: +, -, * and /. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) + lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) - lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) / lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) * lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

</ul>

<p>And finally it also supports the relational operators: <i>==</i>, <i>&gt;</i>, <i>&gt;=</i>, <i>&lt;</i>, 
<i>&lt;=</i> and <i>!=</i>. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) == lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) &gt; lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) &gt;= lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) &lt; lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) &lt;= lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

<li>
<code>lag(day_close, 0) != lag(day_close, -1)
</code>
</li>

</ul>



<h3>7.2 Gondola Functions</h3>

<h3>7.2.1 Average</h3>

<p>The average function averages a series of stock quotes.</p>

<p>
<code>avg(QUOTE, DAYS, START_OFFSET)</code>
</p>

<p>Where QUOTE is <i>day_open</i>, <i>day_close</i>, <i>day_low</i>, <i>day_high</i> or <i>day_volume</i>.
Where DAYS is the number of days to average.
Where START_OFFSET is the most recent date to average, 0 means the current 
trading date, -1 means the previous trading date, etc.</p>

will be executed, otherwise the FALSE expression will be.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>
<code>if(lag(day_open, 0) &gt; lag(day_open, -1)) 
    { lag(day_open, 0) }

<h3>7.2.3 Lag</h3>

<p>The lag function returns a stock quote.</p>

<p>
<code>lag(QUOTE, OFFSET)</code>

</p>

<p>Where QUOTE is <i>day_open</i>, <i>day_close</i>, <i>day_low</i>, <i>day_high</i> or <i>day_volume</i>.
Where DAYS is the number of days to search.
Where START_OFFSET is the most recent date to search, 0 means the current 
trading date, -1 means the previous trading date, etc.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>
<code>max(day_volume, 15, -1)</code>

<h2>
<a name="Analysis"></a>8 Analysis</h2>

<p>Currently the only special analysis tool that Venice has is paper trading.</p>


<h3>8.1 Paper Trade</h3>

<p>Venice allows you to perform historical paper trading, this allows you to test
buy/sell rules using historical share data. You need to enter basic data such 
as which shares you wish to trade (either from a select list or say all 
ordinary shares), the buy/sell rules you wish to trigger the trades, the date 
range over which to trade, and the initial capital. Venice will then pretend 
to buy and sell shares over that time range and will generate a portfolio
detailing all its trades and the final portfolio value. You can bring up
the paper trade dialogue by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on the <i>Analysis</i> menu item.
</li>

<li>Then clicking on the <i>Paper Trade</i> menu item.
</li>

</ul>

<p>First you need to enter the date range for which to perform the paper trade.
For example you could enter the starting date <i>3/1/1997</i> and the ending
date <i>5/1/1998</i>. Next select which symbols you wish to trade, you can
select either <i>All Ordinaries</i>, <i>All Symbols</i>, <i>Market Indices</i>
or type in a list of stock quotes. For example you could type in <i>CBA</i>.
Next you need to enter in the buy/sell rules. These rules are written in the
<a href="#Gondola">Gondola Language</a> so see that section for details. The range
fields allow you to test multiple equations at once, if you enter a value in
one of the fields, say the <i>Range $A: 1 to</i>, it will run separate paper 
trades using the buy/sell rules where each occurrence of <i>$A</i> will be
replaced by 1, then 2, then 3 etc up to the number entered. You can leave these
empty if you only wish to test a single equation. An example of a (bad) 
buy/sell rule pair is buy on <code>avg(day_close, 15, 0) &gt; avg(day_close, 30, 0)</code> and 
sell on <code>avg(day_close, 15, 0) &lt; avg(day_close, 30, 0)</code>. The <i>Initial Capital</i>
is the amount of cash started with the portfolio and the <i>Trade Cost</i> is
the amount of money lost per trade. Once these values are filled in you can
hit the <i>Paper Trade</i> button to initialise the trade. It will
load the quotes, perform the calculations and bring up the <i>Paper Trade 
Results</i> table.</p>


<p>You can perform subsequent paper trades while the paper trade result table is
up. If you modify the values in the dialogue and hit the <i>Paper Trade</i> button
again it will perform another paper trade and add the results to the table.</p>

<h3>8.1.1 Paper Trade Results</h3>

<p>The paper trade results table lists all the result of the paper trades. The 
result of each paper trade performed by the paper trade dialogue will come up 
in a new single row - except if you are running through a family of equations,
in which case multiple rows will be added - a new row for each equation. From
the table you can open the portfolio generated by the paper trade, from
here you can list all the trades performed, see how many and which shares
are currently held and see how much money is left in cash and how much is
in shares. From here for from the table you can also graph the portfolio
which will show you how the portfolio performed over time.</p>
